## How to use VMD

### Installing VMD  
The pre-compiled version of the software can be downloaded [here](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD) (for both LINUX and MacOS X). Registration (harmless) is required.  
Then the instructions at [this](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/ig/node6.html) link can be followed to install it.

### Visualization of MD trajectories  
1. The VMD Main and OpenGL Display panels: going through a loaded trajectory, rotate, translate, zoom in/out and reset view
2. The Graphical Representations panel: changing the visual representation of the molecules, making selections, visualization of multiple frames

### Comparing different trajectories from SimpleMD
1. Opening multiple trajectories at the same time
2. Wrapped atoms inside the box
3. Comparing the system behavior under different conditions: no forces, with forces, melting
4. Save visualization state
5. Rendering nice images from VMD visualization

### A more biological example: visualizing GAC RNA
1. More specific selections: nucleic, water, ions, resid
2. Playing with the graphical representations
